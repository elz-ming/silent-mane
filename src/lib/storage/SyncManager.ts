 *      remote that records {path → contentHash, syncedAt} for every file at
 *      the time of the last successful sync.
 *   2. On sync: compare current content hashes against the manifest.
 *      - Only local changed  → push to remote (no conflict).
 *      - Only remote changed → pull to local (no conflict).
 *      - Both changed        → conflict; add to conflicts list, skip the file.
 *      - Neither changed     → no-op.
 *   3. resolveConflict picks a side and updates the manifest entry.
